        <h1>Embarking on a Web Development Journey: My First Steps</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>- Introduction</h3>
            <p>In this blog, I want to share my first experience entering the world of web development. I will narrate the feelings, challenges, and initial achievements I went through. Hopefully, this story can provide inspiration and assistance for those who are also embarking on a similar journey.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>- The Beginning of Everything</h3>
            <p>Initially, entering the world of web development felt like stepping into a wild forest. I was confronted with various programming languages, foreign concepts, and new tools I had never encountered before. It felt like I was on a continent I had never visited before. At first, I felt insecure because almost all of my classmates had a background related to programming. However, the advantage of having such an environment was that it fueled my motivation to learn even harder. Also, if I encountered difficulties in completing my tasks, I could always ask my classmates for help.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>- Mastering Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>After overcoming the feeling of being overwhelmed, I decided to focus on one programming language first. I chose HTML and CSS because I wanted to understand how web design works. To be honest, I enjoyed learning about User Interface, but as time went on, it seemed like I needed a deeper understanding of web development. I started from the basics and completed various online courses while also reading reference books. As for online resources regarding HTML and CSS, I would like to recommend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">FreeCodeCamp.</a></p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>- Understanding Basic Concepts</h3>
            <p>I realized the importance of understanding the basic concepts in web development. Mastering HTML for structure, CSS for layout and style, and JavaScript for interactivity are crucial initial steps. <br><br>
            <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages. In HTML, you use tags to mark elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and much more.<br> 

                Example of HTML Usage:
            <ul>
                <li>!DOCTYPE html: Defines the document type as HTML.</li>
                <li>html: Starts and ends the HTML element.</li>
                <li>head: Contains information about the document like title, meta tags, and links to external files.</li>
                <li>title: Specifies the title of the page displayed in the browser tab.</li>
                <li>body: Contains the main content of the web page.</li>
                <li>h1: Heading level 1 (main heading).</li>
                <li>p: Paragraph.</li>
                <li>img: Image.</li>
                <li>a: Link.</li>
            </ul> <br>
                <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), </b>CSS is used to control the layout and style of web pages. It allows you to separate structure and design, so you can change the appearance of a web page without altering its structure. <br> <br>
                <b>JavaScript, </b>JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactivity on web pages. It enables you to modify content, respond to user actions, and communicate with the server.
